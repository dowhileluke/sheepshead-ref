Bids of equal rank are won by the player with positional priority.

The bidder MUST exchange with the blind for contracts smaller than a solo.

Before playing to the first trick, the bidder may immediately surrender their contract after exchanging with the blind.

## Bonuses

If the bidder captures the first five tricks, they must cease playing or attempt to capture all remaining tricks (Tout). A successful Tout increases the game value by 1; failure reduces the value by 1.
